AI Games

This is a set of games generated by google.gemeni.ai. !!


Creation was as simple as 'create a tetris game to run in Pythonista'

I'm very impressed with the quality. 
None would run imeediately, there has always been some modifications to make.

Some examples:

1. Gemini does not know the icon or sound library to use, 
   so we always need to replace icon or sound strings.
   
2. it occasionally tries to use non existent scene functions,
    e.g. Point.normalized()
    i replaced this with normalize(Point) where normalize
    returns the sign of Point(x,y)
    would be pretty easy to subclass scene.Point
    
3. it assumes that scene.update takes an argument dt, whereas it actually
    possesses self.dt
4. it may try to update Node.position.x, which does NOT move the node.
   This took me a while to find!
    Replace this by Node.position = (newposx, Node.position.y) # to just change x
    
So far, it has generated Tetris, Galaxians and Pong.

Debug notes:
it can be difficult to debug Scene games, as breakpoints freeze the program without
showing the debug panel
I suggest adding a 'raise Exception' line to break execution while preserving variable values.
Else use print statements to trace execution, which you can see once you press the 'X' button
to halt the program.
