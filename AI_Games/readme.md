AI Games
--------

This is a set of games generated by google.gemeni.ai. !!


Creation was as simple as 'create a tetris game to run in Pythonista'

I'm very impressed with the quality. 
None would run immediately, there has always been some modifications to make.

Some examples:

1. Gemini does not know about the icon or sound library, 
   so we always need to replace icon or sound strings.
   
2. it occasionally tries to use non existent scene functions,
    e.g. Point.normalized().
    It is fairly easy to see what is intended, so is easy to add
    or modify the function call.
    I replaced this with normalize(Point) where normalize
    returns the sign of Point(x,y)
    would be pretty easy to subclass scene.Point
    
3. it assumes that scene.update takes an argument dt, whereas it actually
    possesses self.dt
4. it may try to update Node.position.x, which does NOT move the node.
   This took me a while to find!
    Replace this by Node.position = (newposx, Node.position.y) # to just change x
    
So far, it has generated the games below.
As I have been interested in the techniques and structures, many of these games are working but unfinished.
Feel free to use them as a starting point as I have done.

Debug notes:
it can be difficult to debug Scene games, as breakpoints freeze the program without
showing the debug panel
I suggest adding a 'raise Exception' line to break execution while preserving variable values.
Else use print statements to trace execution, which you can see once you press the 'X' button
to halt the program.

Notes on the programs:
Pong
----
This worked pretty well 'out of the box'. 
Simply needed to replace block graphics with sprite images.
Plays surprisingly well after all these years!

Tetris
------
Proof of concept but not bad. 
Swiping down does not work for dropdown.

Galaxians (invaders_ai)
---------
Replaced sprites but otherwise untouched.
Quite suitable for more enhancements

Flappy
------
Quite basic abd a little hard to debug. 
Pipe creation logic and collision detection was a little messed up.
Sort of works but not my favourite in terms of gameplay.


Battlezone
----------
A real blast from the past!
I was interested in Pythonista for wireframe graphics, and Gemini AI rose to the challenge.
I improved the shape of the turret and attempted to get the rotation of the tank barrel correct.
Its still not right - challenge!

Four-in-a-Row
-------------
Completely produced by Gemini, including good minmax algorithm.


Lander
------
A proof of concept. 
Improved the lander wireframe and added rotation buttons.
Could be much improved 

Missile Command
---------------
A decent working game.
added sprites for cities, player missile and bases.


Pool
----
Proof of concept, but very good physics and user interface.
Table and pockets needed some work.
Define font for lines in measure_string and draw_string
# change dt to 0.2 in function update
# changed colours
# changed random positioning by shuffling only the locations leaving id and colour alone

It would be interesting to create striped ball colours.


Rubik
-----
A proof of concept to play with sceneKit.
I uploaded sceneKit demo 06_photoCubewithRendererDelegate.py and asked Gemini to convert
this to a Rubik Cube.
The main issue with the AI produced image was that the faces were scrambled. 
Some serious debugging required to solve.
Front face and back face rotation are not yet correct.


Tank
----
A very simple overhead tank battle in a maze.
Lots of changes to graphics and ai movement.
Not that interesting a game - unfortunately.


Final observations.
-------------------

Gemini AI code generation produces a very reasonable starting point for producing
code in Pythonista. It certainly makes mistakes and invents functions, but explains
its logic and adds very good comments.
Of course, debugging code written by someone else (even a computer) requires a skill
level above beginner.

As Gemini itself puts it:
Debugging and improving code generated by Gemini AI, while leveraging its advanced capabilities, still necessitates a strong set of human skills. Foremost is a deep understanding of the programming language and domain-specific knowledge to accurately identify logical errors, inefficiencies, or incorrect assumptions made by the AI. This includes the ability to meticulously trace execution, interpret error messages, and formulate effective test cases. Furthermore, critical thinking is paramount to discern why the AI might have produced a particular output and to anticipate potential edge cases it may have overlooked. The human developer must also possess the creativity to envision alternative, more optimal solutions and the refactoring skills to integrate improvements seamlessly, ensuring the final code is not only functional but also maintainable, scalable, and adheres to best practices.
