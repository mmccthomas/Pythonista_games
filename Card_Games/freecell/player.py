Welcome to FreeCell by Akshay!
Press the quit button to leave :(, undo
to undo (shocking, I know), hint to see a
move suggested, or help to see...well,
this. To actually play, drag and drop cards
into place, or type a move at the prompt,
and hit the enter button. To save, load, or
execute a game, you can also enter a command at the prompt
    
Legal commands that you can enter at the prompt:

cf n -- move bottom card of cascade n to foundation
xf n -- move freecell card n to foundation
cx m n -- move bottom card of cascade m to freecell n
xc m n -- move freecell card m to cascade n
xx m n -- move freecell card m to freecell n
cc m n -- move bottom card of cascade m to cascade n
cc m n p -- move p bottom cards of cascade m to cascade n

save -- enter or select a file (must be .txt) to save the game to
save <filename> -- saves game as <filename> (will add .txt extension)
load -- enter a file (.txt) to load and play
load <filename> -- loads the file <filename>
execute -- enter a file (.txt) that should have one of the above moves on each
line, to execute those moves in order
execute <filename> -- will execute (make all the moves) the file <filename>
